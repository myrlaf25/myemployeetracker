## Description

My motivation to develop the backend of this app has been to gain experience as a junior developer with new packages. 
This app was built to be able to access a database on MySQL through node.js and inquirer npm. 
The project has a seeds.sql file which contains all the database information. This was hard coded. The database was then pushed into MySQL Workbench. Once it was accessible through MySQL a JavaScript file was created to develop functions to run the program. The first time the terminal was accessed an the following commands were executed: npm init -y, npm i inquirer, and npm i mysql.

## Installation

The user needs to run npm init -y to create a package.json file. The user will then have to install inquirer and MySQL. The app runs in the terminal with npm start command. 


## Usage

The user will have access to a database containing employee information to include but not limited to department name, manager, role, salary, etc. The user will be able to view all 3 different tables by the table name, or view all to view all tables in one. The user will also be able to add role, add department, add employee, and update employee role.
