## Description

My motivation to develop the backend of this app has been to gain experience as a junior developer with new packages. 
This app was built to be able to access a database on MySQL through node.js and inquirer npm. 
The project has a seeds.sql file which contains all the database information. This was hard coded. The database was then pushed into MySQL Workbench. Once it was accessible through MySQL a JavaScript file was created to develop functions to run the program. The first time the terminal was accessed an the following commands were executed: npm init -y, npm i inquirer, and npm i mysql.
